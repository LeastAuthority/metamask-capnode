# Changelog

## Version 4.0.0

Converted streams from `objectMode` to pure text chunks.

## Version 3.0.0

Full Typescript rewrite, broke basically every important API except the basic usage of passing objects around.

## Version <= 2.x.x

Initial versions, nearly written in [Jessie](https://github.com/Agoric/Jessie), thinking it would be really cool if we could get it to work on embedded devices.
