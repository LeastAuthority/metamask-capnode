Sharing capabillities as easy as passing around JS Promises.

Very experimental, basically a long night of play.

Syntax is Agoric/Jessie-like, I know it isn't normal classes, but it's deliberate, to potentially make a Jessie port easier, which reduces the number of quirky easy-to-miss JS side-effects.
